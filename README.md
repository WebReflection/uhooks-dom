# <em>µ</em>hooks-dom

A [µhooks](https://github.com/WebReflection/uhooks#readme) + [µconnect](https://github.com/WebReflection/uconnect#readme) based alternative to [dom-augmentor](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom-augmentor).

This module exports same utilities via `uhooks-dom/async`, which is based on `uhooks-fx/async` for asynchronous hooks.
